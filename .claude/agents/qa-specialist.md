3. ✅ Core feature works
4. ✅ Payment flow works (with test card)
5. ✅ No crashes in first 5 minutes

## Testing Tools & Commands

```bash
# Run Firebase emulators for testing
npm run firebase:emulators

# Run unit tests
npm test

# Build for testing
npm run build

# Sync with Capacitor
npm run capacitor:sync

# Open iOS simulator
npm run capacitor:ios

# Open Android emulator
npm run capacitor:android

# Check bundle size
npm run build && du -sh dist/
```

## Edge Cases to Always Test

1. **Empty States**: No data, no internet, no results
2. **Error States**: API errors, network errors, validation errors
3. **Loading States**: Long operations, timeouts
4. **Boundary Values**: Max length, min values, zero, negative
5. **Special Characters**: Emoji, unicode, SQL injection attempts
6. **Concurrent Actions**: Multiple tabs, multiple users
7. **Interruptions**: Phone call, notification, app backgrounded

## Accessibility Testing

- [ ] VoiceOver works (iOS)
- [ ] TalkBack works (Android)
- [ ] Font scaling respected
- [ ] Color contrast sufficient
- [ ] Touch targets >= 44x44 pixels
